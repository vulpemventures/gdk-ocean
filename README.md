# gdk-ocean

gdk-ocean is a Liquid wallet running on a gRPC server. It implements the [ocean API](https://github.com/vulpemventures/ocean)

# Usage

## Run gdk-ocean locally

The current version of gdk-ocean uses Python 3.9

__the first time you run the program, you have to set up the virtual env with all dependencies.__

Generate the protobuf ocean stubs:
```
make stubs
```

Create virtual env (it needs Python 3.9 installed)
```
make env
```

Then, activate the env and install the `requirements.txt` deps.
```
source venv/bin/activate
make deps
```

At any moment, you can leave the venv with `deactivate`.

Now you can run the server in any Python 3.9 environmnent:
```
make run
```
By default, the server is running on port 50051.

With Python venv, you are also able to run the tests using.
As the integration tests are running on testnet network, you have to set up the `TESTNET_TEST_MNEMONIC` env variable with a valid mnemonic owning some testnet L-BTC and AMP test asset.

```
make test
```

## Run gdk-ocean in a Docker container

Init the submodules and copy the proto stubs:
```
make stubs
```

Build the image:
```bash
docker build -t gdk-ocean . # -t is the image name
```

Run a container:
```bash
docker run gdk-ocean 
```

Once the container is running, you can request it via the exposed port 50051.

## CLI

You can communicate with gdk-ocean using the `cli.py` script. It must be run by python3.9.

In your virtual enviroment, install the CLI dependencies:
```bash
make deps-cli
```

> if you are running the server in a container or if u don't want to mix CLI & server env, you can create venv with: `python3.9 -m venv venv_cli`

The CLI can connect to a gdk-ocean server using `--host` and `--port` options
```bash
python cli.py --address 0.0.0.0:8080 <command>
python cli.py <command> # if not set, cli.py requests localhost:50051 by default
``` 

Try to create your wallet using the cli:
```bash
python cli.py genseed # write down your secret words!
python cli.py create -m "<seed>" -p "<password>"
```

You can print the list of commands by running `python cli.py --help`. Any command help message can be printed by running `python cli.py <command> --help`.
